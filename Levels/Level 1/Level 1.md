## Room A9

Includes all the enemies
Will test the player skill against all type of enemy 
Challenge player platforming ability ( it will be easier if the player learn the energy shot ) --> placing multiple enemy in a straight line will help with this 

Layout ideas 
* zigzag layout: %% Test platforming abilities, teach the player how to [[Pogo (en-US)]],  %% --> Shouldn't, learned from Hollow Knight, introduce this mechanic gradually, this is a useful and slightly difficult and advanced mechanic to pull through.
