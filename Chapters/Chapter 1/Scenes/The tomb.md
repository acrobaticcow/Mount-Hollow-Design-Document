A room carve out of a great block of stone, decorated with beautiful relief. This room was built with someone in mind, someone that are much loved and revered. 

In the middle of a room is a sword burning with green fire. You wake up standing underneath a pedestal with no statue above. You reach for the sword. At the moment you do it, the fire go inside you, slithering gently into its home. The door is then open, you are out. 

Outside is the hallway. From here you can view the city beneath, everything is in rumble and swallow by fire, the lack of human voices is unnerving, even a cry could be hopeful. From a far you see a glimpse of a grand castle.
